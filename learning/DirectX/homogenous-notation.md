# Homogenous Notation

A coordinate is described using homogenous notation when it is represented by a four value vector (x, y, z, w), where:

(x, y, z, 0) = vector.

(x, y, z, 1) = point.

That is, the same notation is used to describe both vectors and points, and what is used to differentiate them is the w-component.
