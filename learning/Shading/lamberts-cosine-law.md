# Lambert's Cosine Law

Light that strikes a surface point head-on is more intense than light that glances a surface point.

The function should return max intensity when the vertex normal and light vector are perfectly aligned (angle of 0 degrees between them), and minimum intensity when the vertex normal and light vector has an angle above 90 degrees (as it would strike the back of the surface).

*Lambert's cosine law* gives us such a function.
