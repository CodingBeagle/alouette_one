# Linear Transformations

Transformation = Mapping = Function

That is, a transformation/mapping/function is a rule that takes some input and produces an output.

A **linear transformation** is a transformation which preserves operations of addition and multiplication by a scalar. That is:

F(a) + F(b) = F(a+b)
kF(a) = F(ka)

The transformation *F(a)=aM*, where *M* is a matrix and *a* a vector, is a linear transformation.

**Affine transformations** are linear transformations *followed* by a translation.
