# Quaternions

Quaternions have a practical use in representing 3D rotation and orientation.

Quaternions used to describe 3D rotation are **unit quaternions**.

unit quaternion = The sum of the squares of all 4 real numbers equals 1.

## Dimensions

Quaternions are a 4 dimensional number system.

One quaternion consists of 4 real number parts:

*q = s + xi + yj + zk*

Where s, x, y, and z are real numbers.

unit quaternion = The sum of the squares of all 4 real numbers equals 1. That is, it's length is 1.

## Intuition

It can be hard to visualize how a 4 dimensional number can represent rotation in 3D space.

Visualizing a quaternion is essentially impossible, in the sense that unit quaternions form a **hypersphere** in 4d space.

You can intuit a bit of it by thinking about stereographic projections.

The idea of a stereographic projection being that you can map the surface of a higher dimensional shape to one of lower dimenions.

Example: You can map, or project, all points (except one) on a 2D circle onto a line.
